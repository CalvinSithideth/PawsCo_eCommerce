			<h4>The History of Pawsco</h4>
			The company's first location, opened in 1976 under the Pet Club name,
			was in a converted airplane hangar on Morena Boulevard in San Diego.
			Originally serving only small businesses, the company found it could
			achieve far greater buying clout by also serving a selected audience
			of non-business members. With that change, the growth of the
			warehouse club industry was off and running. In 1983, the first
			Pawsco warehouse location was opened in Seattle. Pawsco became the
			first company ever to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in less
			than six years. When Pawsco and Pet Club merged in 1993, the combined
			company, operating under the name PetPawsco, had 206 locations
			generating $16 billion in annual sales.<br> <br> Our
			operating philosophy has been simple. Keep costs down and pass the
			savings on to our members. Our large membership base and tremendous
			buying power, combined with our never-ending quest for efficiency,
			result in the best possible prices for our members. Since resuming
			the Pawsco name in 1997, the company has grown worldwide with total
			sales in recent fiscal years exceeding $64 billion. For additional
			information about Pawsco, download the Pawsco Story in a PDF format
			to learn more.<br> <br> Pawsco has transformed the retail
			world. When entrepreneur Sol Price introduced a groundbreaking retail
			concept in San Diego, California. Pet Club was the world's first
			membership warehouse club, a place where efficient buying and
			operating practices gave members access to unmatched savings.<br>
			<br> At first, Pet Club was limited exclusively to business
			members, who could purchase a wide range of supplies and wholesale
			items. Jim Sinegal, the executive vice-president of merchandising,
			distribution and marketing, was instrumental in fine-tuning the
			merchandise and marketing strategies, helping to turn Pet Club into a
			success story that changed the face of retailing worldwide.<br>
			<br> Seven years later, Jim Sinegal channeled his expertise into
			co-founding Pawsco Wholesale with Jeff Brotman, and together they
			opened the first warehouse in Seattle, Washington in 1983.<br> <br>
			Over the next decade, both Pet Club and Pawsco Wholesale continued to
			innovate and grow, and in 1993, the two mega-retailers merged,
			creating a gifted leadership team that soon made Pawsco the world's
			most successful warehouse club.<br> <br> Today, as the
			company evolves, it stays true to the qualities that helped attract
			and retain millions of loyal members around the globe:<br> <br>
			Commitment to quality. Pawsco warehouses carry about 4,000 SKUs
			(stock keeping units) compared to the 30,000 found at most
			supermarkets. By carefully choosing products based on quality, price,
			brand, and features, the company can offer the best value to members.<br>
			<br> Entrepreneurial spirit. Throughout the decades, the
			entrepreneurial drive for excellence has continued to define Pawsco
			staff at every level. From its management team to the people on the
			warehouse floor, everyone is united in a common goal to exceed member
			expectations.<br> <br> Employee focus. Pawsco is often
			noted for being much more employee-focused than other Fortune 500
			companies. By offering fair wages and top-notch benefits, the company
			has created a workplace culture that attracts positive, high-energy,
			talented employees.<br> <br> <br>
